            <h1>How To Read Tarot</h1>
            <p>Reading tarot is both an art and a personal journey. At its core, tarot is about interpreting the cards to gain insight into a question or situation. To begin, you'll need a tarot deck, which typically consists of 78 cards divided into two main categories: the Major Arcana and the Minor Arcana. The Major Arcana represents key life themes and lessons, while the Minor Arcana focuses on everyday situations and emotions. During a reading, you shuffle the cards, think about a question or topic, and then pull a specific number of cards from the deck to form a spread. The placement and combination of cards provide the foundation for your interpretation.</p>

            <h4>Minor Arcana</h4>
                <p>These cards carry powerful meanings that address major life events, choices, and spiritual lessons. The remaining 56 cards belong to the Minor Arcana, which is divided into four suits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cups</li>
                <li>Swords</li>
                <li>Pentacles</li>
                <li>Wands</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Each suit contains 14 cards, ranging from <span>Ace to 10</span>, followed by four Court Cards: <span>Page</span>, <span>Knight</span>, <span>Queen</span>, and <span>King</span>. These cards reflect day-to-day concerns, such as emotions, actions, decisions, and material matters. Together, the Major and Minor Arcana provide a well-rounded system for understanding both large and small influences in a reading.</p>

            <h4>Intuition and Reading</h4>
            <p>When you perform a reading, it’s important to trust your intuition. While each card has a traditional meaning, how the cards interact with one another and the question you're asking is key. You can start simple, with a one-card pull for daily guidance, or use a more complex spread like the Three-Card Spread or an even more complex spread like the Celtic Cross to gain deeper insight into a situation. Even moreso, depending on the tarot deck you own, there may be unique symbolism and meanings within the art of the cards. As well, there may be some unique spreads included in the booklet that comes with it. There’s no wrong way to start, and with practice, you'll develop a style and method that feels right for you.</p>
